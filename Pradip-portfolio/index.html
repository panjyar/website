                    <p>
                    I am a computer student and purshing B.tech from Central Institute of Technology Kokrajhar,Assam . I’m skilled with C,C++ ,HTML,CSS and Java, and I am trying to learn other programming languages, step by step. I try to get the most out of my time at the college, and have some edge once I graduate, which is the primary reason why I seek a part time job with you.</p>
                    <p>I’m a strong communicator and I take pride in my honesty, too. In university, I led multiple clubs and group projects where I had the chance to build my communication skills including public speaking. And I’m always clear and upfront in my communication. I’m proud of the fact that I’m honest and transparent in my work. I saw on your job description that this position may lead some committees and meetings, so that’s one detail that attracted me to your organization and made me think I’d be able to put my communication skills to good use here.</p>

Freelancing offers the freedom and flexibility to choose one's own projects and clients, but it also requires a high level of self-motivation and discipline.</p>
